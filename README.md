# Rust todo app

### :round_pushpin: Purpose
This is a simple todo list where you display your todo items, however there is no database storage functionality yet.

### Getting started
#### 1. After cloning this repo and opening it up in your own text editor, install Rust:
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
<br/>
<br/>
After installing, you may need to re-start your shell

#### 2. Check the install
`rustc --version`</br>
`cargo --version`

#### 3. Create a cargo build
`cargo build`

#### 4. Run the program
`cargo run`
<br/>
<br/>
You should see prompts with number options for adding/viewing/marking todo items in your list. if you want to end the program, press "4" when asked what to do next, the program then ends
